# CSV SQL Live!

Todo:

- show errors when loading new file within modal, and delete table on error (or tx)
- handle weird column names, and display converted column names
  - table names too
  - some library to do it?
- way to view tables loaded currently and schema (maybe another button)

- no external assets
- analytics
- fancy grid features
  - filters http://adazzle.github.io/react-data-grid/examples.html#/filterable-grid
