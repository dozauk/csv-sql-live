Todo:

- show errors when loading new file within modal, and delete table on error (or tx)
- handle weird column names, and display converted column names
- customizable table name, default to filename minus extension
- persistent "Add CSV File" button, with modal form. form open by default for first file
  - somehow still display info text for first modal ("init" state)
- way to view tables loaded currently and schema (maybe another button)

- no external assets
- analytics
- fancy grid features
  - filters http://adazzle.github.io/react-data-grid/examples.html#/filterable-grid
