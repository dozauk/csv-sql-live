Todo:

- display something when add form is closed and no tables exist. or don't let add form be closed then?
  - currently not letting it close, but then footer links are visible but inaccessible
- handle weird column names, and display converted column names
  - table names too
  - some library to do it?

- no external assets
- analytics
- fancy grid features
